<strong>About dataset</strong>


Cancers are associated with genetic abnormalities. Gene expression measures the level of gene activity in a tissue and gives information about its complex activities. Comparing the genes expressed in normal and diseased tissue can bring better insights into the cancer prognosis and outcomes. Using machine learning techniques on genetic data has the potentials of giving the correct estimation of survival time and can prevent unnecessary surgical and treatment procedures.

Content
The Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) database is a Canada-UK Project which contains targeted sequencing data of 1,980 primary breast cancer samples. Clinical and genomic data was downloaded from cBioPortal.

The dataset was collected by Professor Carlos Caldas from Cambridge Research Institute and Professor Sam Aparicio from the British Columbia Cancer Centre in Canada and published on Nature Communications (Pereira et al., 2016).

<strong>About This code</strong>


- We were requiered to do a lot of visuals on the dataset as well as a good cleaning, this code focus on this more than building a model, a lot of models were tested (machine learning and deep learning) the best accuracy was obtained by the DL model on the (clinical+genetic) dataset (0.92483)
